# FinancialFuturesAnalyzer
Project Overview

This is a standalone Java application built to analyze simulated daily trading data for a financial futures contract. It was developed to demonstrate strong Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a high-relevance domain (market data processing).

The project structure is designed for scalability and maintainability, mimicking the core tasks required to process, analyze, and report on market activity‚Äîskills crucial for platform engineering and financial technology roles.

Key Skills & Features

Clean OOP Structure: Separates concerns using dedicated classes (DailyPriceData and MarketAnalyzer) for data modeling and logic execution. This demonstrates Java OOP, encapsulation, and modular design.

Market Data Handling: Simulates loading and storing 30 days of price and volume data using the Java Collections Framework (ArrayList).

Financial Analysis: Calculates essential market metrics, including the Average Closing Price, Total Price Swing, and identifies the Max Volume Day.

Professional Output: Generates a clean, formatted report directly to the console, prioritizing readability and accurate presentation using structured I/O.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Language: Java

Concepts: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, Methods, Encapsulation.

üèÉ How to Run the Project

This project requires a Java Development Kit (JDK 8 or newer).

Setup: Ensure both DailyPriceData.java and MarketAnalyzer.java are in the same folder.

Compile: Use the terminal/command prompt to compile the files:

javac DailyPriceData.java MarketAnalyzer.java


Execute: Run the main analysis class:

java MarketAnalyzer


Console Output

The program outputs a status confirmation followed by the detailed analytical report on the simulated data.
